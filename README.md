The count matrix is too big to upload, so I put it in **CyVerse Discovery Environment** website, you can download it from [here](https://de.cyverse.org/dl/d/5CAF9EDD-4769-4A19-B3F9-51368571E76C/Count_matrix.tar.gz).

## Peaks visualization

The files after peak calling was in a bedGraph format, then be converted to BigWig format which can be uploaded to UCSC browser directly. The BigWig file was uploaded in **CyVerse Discovery Environment**, and the URL was in [Peaks_URL.md](https://github.com/goushixue/mouse-single-cell-ATAC-seq/blob/master/Peaks_URL.md) of this Repository. You can copy the URL to the UCSC's **Custom Tracks** to view it.
